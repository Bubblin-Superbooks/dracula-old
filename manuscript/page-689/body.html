<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it!”</p><p>Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:—</p><p>“My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then—then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.</p></div> </div>
