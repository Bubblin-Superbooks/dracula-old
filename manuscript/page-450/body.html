She greeted us warmly and said:—</p><p>“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his hands together, and said:—</p><p>“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to which she answered:—</p><p>“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this morning is due in part to me.”</p></div> </div>
