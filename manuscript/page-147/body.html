<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line">very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just <i>do for you</i>, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent <i>parti</i>, being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read oneâ€™s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? <i>I do</i>, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well</p></div> </div>
