<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly realâ€”so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.</p><p>I was not alone.</p></div> </div>
