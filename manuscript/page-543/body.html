I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.”</p><p>“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:—</p><p>“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was—only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.”</p></div> </div>
