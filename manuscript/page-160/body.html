His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.</p><p>There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.</p><p>I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.</p><p>What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?</p></div> </div>
