You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong with her? The Dutchman—and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that—said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have <i>another</i> transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you medical men speak <i>in camera</i>, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?”</p><p>“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:—</p><p>“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day. Is not that so?”</p><p>“That’s so.”</p></div> </div>
