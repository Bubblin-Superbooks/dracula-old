THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR. ANOTHER CHILD INJURED. The “Bloofer Lady.”</p><p>We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases.</p></div> </div>
