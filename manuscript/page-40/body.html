<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driverâ€™s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it.</p></div> </div>
