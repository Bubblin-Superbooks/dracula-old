Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch ’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”</p><p>This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change.</p></div> </div>
