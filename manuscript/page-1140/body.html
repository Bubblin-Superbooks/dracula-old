A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:—</p><p>“Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:—</p><p>“But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid; John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!”</p><p>“I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.”</p></div> </div>
