Under way at 4 p. m.</p><p>On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.</p><p>On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.</p><p>On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was something, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.</p></div> </div>
