For at this hour you do not want me for nothings.”</p><p>“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.</p><p>Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn.
