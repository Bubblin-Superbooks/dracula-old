<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Telegram, October 24th.</p><p>Rufus Smith, Lloyd’s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M. Vice-Consul, Varna. “Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.”</p><p>Dr. Seward’s Diary.</p><p>25 October.—How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd’s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence.</p></div> </div>
